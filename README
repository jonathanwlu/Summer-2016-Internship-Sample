# Summer 2016 Code Sample

This is a code sample from my Summer 2016 internship at Blackstone.  It has been edited to remove any proprietary code or information.

Originally used to plot time series of stock portfolios using matplotlib.  Not functional as-is, as database query code as been removed.
